/*
 * You might wonder why a non-blocking read is still necessary even after select() indicates that a socket is ready.
 * The reason is that select() only tells you that the socket was ready at the time of the check.
 * However, by the time you call read(), the data might have already been consumed by another thread or process,
 * resulting in a blocking call if the socket is no longer ready â€” this is a classic race condition.
 *
 * Calling a blocking read() in this case defeats the purpose of using I/O multiplexing,
 * which is intended to avoid blocking and allow efficient handling of multiple connections.
 *
 * Timeline example:
 * [T1] select() says socket A is readable
 * [T2] another thread reads from socket A
 * [T3] current thread calls blocking read() on socket A => BLOCKS!
