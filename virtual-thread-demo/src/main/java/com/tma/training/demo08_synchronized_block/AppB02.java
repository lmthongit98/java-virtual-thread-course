/*
 * SYNCHRONIZED BLOCKS
 * Version B02: Synchronized instance methods
 *
 * Assume there is a synchronized method "run" in object X:
 * Multiple threads associating with X should synchronize (block) when they execute method "run".
 *
 * If multiple threads associate with multiple objects (each thread ~ each object),
 *      they will NOT SYNCHRONIZE when execute method "run".
 *
 *      In demo code below, we create multiple Worker objects, so the problem happens.
